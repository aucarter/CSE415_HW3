miniMax 
    # If at max depth, run staticEval on the state and return the number
    # Figure out whose turn it is
    # Identify admissible moves (function of state and whose turn it is)
    # For each admissible move:
        # Run miniMax on the updated state (Should return a single value)
            - Increment the depth
            - Swap whose turn it is
    # If W, pick the max option. If R, pick the min option
    # Return the move that wins at the top of your recursion


Move options:
- Pass
- Pass after the first checker
- Move from the bar (use 0 for this)
    Must have a checker on the bar
- Reverse the order of the die
- Move the same checker twice (use as second argument the point number where the checker will be after first move)
